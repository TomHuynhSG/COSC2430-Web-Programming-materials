    <h1>Heading 1 with External style sheets</h1>
    <p>[Task] Inspect the CSS file "styles.css" in the same folder of the index.html</p>
    <p>This is the most recomended way to attach CSS to HTML documents as it is very flexible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can reapply the same CSS file to multiple different HTML documents.</li>
            <li>You can break CSS styles into multiple different CSS files (style sheets) which contain different styles for different pages. No more one single big CSS style sheets to target all pages.</li>
            <li>Keep the HTML document clean and neat just for the content of the website while CSS files are for the presentation. (Seperation of concerns!)</li>
        </ul>
